// Rectifying is the first step in the board detection.
// Motivation: The image of a board is usually messy (contains background and the board in some angle). This makes it hard to analyse the board. This should be
// fixed before further processing. Goal:       Given a messy image of a board, produce an image where the board is visible from a top-down view without
// background and perfectly square edges. Process:
//   1) We detect a rough outline of the board (function warpToBoard) and warp to top-down view. Here, it's not yet clear if the border of the produced image is
//   correct. 2) We fine-tune this board detection (function rectifyImage). Using the projected board image, we detect grid lines, crop the image to the edge
//   grid lines + padding of a half stone.
